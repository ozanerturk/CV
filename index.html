            <i>As a person,</i><br>

            <p>
                I was born in 1995. After I graduated, I spent most of my time to be better at programming and to
                understand
                the
                mindset of being a developer.
                For me, It is not only about being good at coding. It is also being a part of something bigger. The
                application,
                progress', pipelines and communication with other team members.
                Whatever the problem is, even it is about taking note or talking with a customer, my approach is same:
                Analyze and determine the problem, define it, generate a solution, test it, refine it, track it and do
                it
                better.
                I do not hesitate to take responsibility.
                I like art, reading 19th-century writers, playing music (and it gave me the meaning of doing practise).
                I
                like
                to
                talk about psychology and human behavior.
